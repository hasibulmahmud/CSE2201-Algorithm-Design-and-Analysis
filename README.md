Algorithms
ðŸ“– Overview

Welcome to the Algorithms Repository!
This project contains implementations of a wide range of Algorithms in C++.
Each program is written with clarity and includes comments to help with understanding the logic and flow of the algorithm.

âœ¨ Features

Implementation of major algorithm categories:

Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)

Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.)

Recursion (Factorial, Fibonacci, Backtracking, etc.)

Greedy Algorithms (Activity Selection, Huffman Coding, etc.)

Divide and Conquer (Merge Sort, Binary Search, etc.)

Dynamic Programming (Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence, etc.)

Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Kruskal, Prim, etc.)

Mathematical Algorithms (GCD, Prime Numbers, Modular Arithmetic, etc.)

Clean and readable C++ code.

Organized folder structure by algorithm type.

Regular updates with new algorithms.
